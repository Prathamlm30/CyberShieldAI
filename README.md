üõ°Ô∏è CyberShield AI: Your Personal Command Center for Digital Sovereignty
Live Application URL: https://cybershieldai01.netlify.app/

CyberShield AI is a next-generation, enterprise-grade threat intelligence platform designed to transform personal cybersecurity from a passive, reactive chore into an empowered, proactive command operation. It provides users with a real-time, unified view of their digital threat landscape, powered by a live, collective defense network.

‚ú® Key Features
CyberShield AI is built around a core set of powerful, integrated features designed to provide unparalleled security insight and control.

üß† Project Oracle: The Security Analysis Engine
Multi-Vector Threat Analysis: Performs a deep, forensically-sound analysis of any URL.

Authoritative Intelligence: Integrates directly with world-class, industry-standard APIs including VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, and AbuseIPDB to deliver factually accurate verdicts.

Defensible Trust Score: Generates a weighted, evidence-based "Trust Score" (0-100) based on validated data points like domain age, SSL/TLS integrity, and consensus from over 70 security vendors.

üåê The Live Collective Defense Network
Community-Powered Intelligence: Users can report suspicious URLs and activities, contributing to a shared intelligence grid.

Real-Time Hardening: Powered by Supabase Realtime Subscriptions, every verified threat report instantly hardens the defenses for the entire user community.

Self-Improving Network Effect: The system creates a powerful, self-improving "digital immune system" that learns and evolves with every new threat, a capability legacy tools cannot replicate.

üìä AI-Powered Threat Analytics
Predictive Insights: Leverages AI to identify emerging threat patterns, trend shifts, and anomalous activity on a global scale.

Actionable Intelligence: Provides users with clear, concise insights into the current threat landscape, including top threat categories and their regional distribution.

Performance Metrics: Displays key AI model performance metrics like prediction accuracy and response time, ensuring transparency and trust.

dashboards Personalized Command Center
A unified dashboard that provides a real-time overview of the user's personal security posture.

Displays key stats like lifetime scans, threats blocked, and an average personal Trust Score.

Maintains a clear log of all recent scan activity.

üöÄ Technology Stack
Our platform is built on a modern, scalable, and high-performance technology stack, chosen for reliability and speed.

Frontend:

Framework: React with Vite for lightning-fast development and performance.

Language: TypeScript for robust, type-safe code.

UI Components: shadcn/ui for accessible, beautifully designed components.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design system.

Backend & Database:

Platform: Supabase (serverless architecture).

Database: Enterprise-grade Postgres.

Real-Time Engine: Supabase Realtime Subscriptions.

Authentication: Supabase Auth for secure user management.

Intelligence Engine:

Core: A server-side Supabase Edge Function ("Project Oracle").

Third-Party APIs: VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing (Web Risk), AbuseIPDB, and WHOIS.

üí° The "Why": The Paradigm Shift
Legacy antivirus is a losing battle. It's reactive, slow, and defenseless against modern threats. CyberShield AI was built to change this paradigm. We believe that true digital security comes from empowerment, real-time intelligence, and collective defense. Our mission is to democratize access to the elite, enterprise-grade security tools that were previously out of reach for everyday users and small businesses, creating a safer and more resilient internet for everyone.
