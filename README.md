## ‚ú® Key Features

CyberShield AI is built around a core set of powerful, integrated features designed to provide unparalleled security insight and control.

üß† **Project Oracle: The Security Analysis Engine**
- **Multi-Vector Threat Analysis:** Performs a deep, forensically-sound analysis of any URL.
- **Authoritative Intelligence:** Integrates directly with world-class, industry-standard APIs including VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, and AbuseIPDB to deliver factually accurate verdicts.
- **Defensible Trust Score:** Generates a weighted, evidence-based "Trust Score" (0-100) based on validated data points like domain age, SSL/TLS integrity, and consensus from over 70 security vendors.

üåê **The Live Collective Defense Network**
- **Community-Powered Intelligence:** Users can report suspicious URLs and activities, contributing to a shared intelligence grid.
- **Real-Time Hardening:** Powered by **Supabase Realtime Subscriptions**, every verified threat report instantly hardens the defenses for the entire user community.
- **Self-Improving Network Effect:** The system creates a powerful, "digital immune system" that learns and evolves with every new threat.

üìä **AI-Powered Threat Analytics**
- **Predictive Insights:** Leverages AI to identify emerging threat patterns, trend shifts, and anomalous activity on a global scale.
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Provides users with clear, concise insights into the current threat landscape.
- **Performance Metrics:** Displays key AI model performance metrics like prediction accuracy and response time, ensuring transparency and trust.

## üí° The "Why": The Paradigm Shift

Legacy antivirus is a losing battle. It's reactive, slow, and defenseless against modern threats. **CyberShield AI** was built to change this paradigm. We believe that true digital security comes from empowerment, real-time intelligence, and collective defense. Our mission is to democratize access to the elite, enterprise-grade security tools that were previously out of reach for everyday users and small businesses, creating a safer and more resilient internet for everyone.
